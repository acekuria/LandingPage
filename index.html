    <p>I am a disciplined UCC first year student currently obtaining a degree in Business Information
        Systems at the honours level. I have a focused ambition to work within various fields. Having
        finished secondary school in May of 2022, achieving 601 points in my Leaving Cert, I have built a
        strong knowledge of business and finance learnt through continuous studies and assessments.
        With my leadership and communicational skills combined with skills I learnt through working
        diligently in, The Lion’s Den Gym Mallow, Co-Op Superstores, Build a Bank with the Bank of
        Ireland and at the Polling Station in Mallow GAA during the 2020 Irish elections, I am well placed
        to start a career within the commercial industry and add value to said industry.</p>

    <p class="quote-text"> “Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and 
        the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is 
        great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you 
        do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. 
        As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.” <b>~Alvin Kuria</b>
